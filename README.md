## Goal
* The goal of this assignment is to build a simple single-screen web app using ReactJS which shows the images of the items searched by the user which are fetched by making API calls to publicly available image providers. The design wireframe and business specifications have been provided which we expect you to follow.
* We have deliberately kept the app simple enough for everyone to attempt it, but we are keen to see the approach you take to solve it. You have the freedom to give your best to it and demonstrate your web development skills for us to evaluate you better.
